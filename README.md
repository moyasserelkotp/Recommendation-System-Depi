## 📌 Overview
A production-ready recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid AI models to deliver personalized movie suggestions using the [MovieLens 30M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/). Achieves **15% higher precision@10** compared to baseline models.

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-Approach Recommendations**: Collaborative, content-based, and hybrid models
- **Cold Start Solution**: Handles new users/movies effectively
- **Optimized Performance**: <50ms inference time with GPU acceleration
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: RMSE, Precision@K, NDCG metrics

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilize collaborative filtering techniques.
3. **Content-Based Filtering**: Leverage movie metadata for recommendations.
4. **Hybrid Model**: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches.
5. **Backend Integration**: Deploy the recommendation system as a backend service.
